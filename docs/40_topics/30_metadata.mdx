# Article about Metadata / MIChI

Metadata can be described as "data about data", that means it is data which describes information, the actual content of a dataset or file, and the context of this information. This may include general information like a title or keywords, information about the acquisition method of data, the people involved, the format of data, the quality or references to other data. For each type of data a different set of metadata may be added. 

Minimum information (MI) standards are guidelines on the metadata, which is required when reporting data and which format should be used for these information and the data. The set of MI depends on the kind of data and is established to ensure that data is deposited following the FAIR principles.
