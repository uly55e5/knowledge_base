# Metadata and Minimum Information

Metadata can be described as "data about data", that means it is data which describes information, the actual content of a dataset or file, and the context of this information. This may include general information like a title or keywords, information about the acquisition method of data, the people and institutions involved, the format of data, the quality or references to other data. For each type of data a different set of metadata may be added. A hierarchical structure of metadata makes it possible to use layers of multiple standards from more generic metadata for digital objects to the more specific ones on samples or instruments. Metadata should be defined by [ontologies](50_ontology.mdx), controlled vocabularies, or [data formats](40_format_standards.mdx).

Minimum information (MI) standards are guidelines on the metadata, which is required when reporting data and which format should be used for these information and the data. The set of MI depends on the type of data and is established to ensure that data is deposited following the FAIR principles. Therefore, minimum information is a subset of rich metadata which can accompany data.

# Metdata and the FAIR principles

The [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)  do do not only apply to data but also for their metadata. More information can be found in the [FAIR article](01_fair.mdx) or on [GoFair](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/).

Metadata, as the data itself, should have assigned unique [persistent identifiers (PID)](100_pid.mdx) to be referenced by publications and other datasets. By organising these PIDs hierarchically each parameter in the metadata can be referenced individually. 
Machine-readable metadata should be in a standard format and document semantics of metadata entities and their relations between them and the actual data. This can be achieved by defining the metadata as an ontology or schema, e.g. for XML or JSON. Schemas will help to index metadata for search engines, repositories or other data registries, but will also improve interoperability. Most of the other FAIR guidelines also apply for metadata.

# General Metadata

There are metadata standards which are independent of the domain they are used in. These models can be used for chemical data to present a minimum set of metadata and may be complemented by more specific metadata. 

The [Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD)](http://icatproject-contrib.github.io/CSMD/) is a model for scientific studies and includes entity classes for facilities, users, investigation, instruments, datafiles, datasets and samples. Within these classes most of the experimental parameters and results can be captured. Additionally, there are classes for e.g. publications, data formats, sample types. Beside a publication of the specification as UML (Unified Modeling language) classes  model definition there is also a representation as  ontology. Future releases will focus on the integration of the PROV model (see below).

[ISA (Investigation Study Assay)](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is also a metadata framework and has schemas to for representation in data formats (ISA-Tab and JSON). It can be applied to many methods and allows including ontology references for the entities.

[Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/) is a more general set of fifteen elements describing networked resources. This set has been adapted and extended by other standards since its first  publication in 1995. 

The DOI provider [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) has developed a [schema](https://schema.datacite.org/) of core metadata for research data. The standard is community driven and tries to integrate with other standards such as Dublin Core and ORCID.

The [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) is a framework for harvesting metadata and can be applied to a wide variety of metadata formats, but these should always include Dublin Core metadata. 

There are many more general metadata standards mainly defined for libraries, collections and database managing digital objects. 

For provenance information there is the W3C standard [PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/), which can be used to provide information on the origin of scientific data.

## Minimum Information for Chemical Investigations (MIChI)

Due to the increasing amount of the data produced by omics,  biology and related disciplines like bioinformatics and biochemistry, have developed  a large set of [minimum information guidelines](https://fairsharing.org/search/?q=minimum+information) for  different methods. These were promoted by the [Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1411) project

Although the explored part of the chemical space along with chemical data produced increases rapidly, there are only few attempts to define guidelines for minimum information in chemistry, e.g. [Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11306-007-0082-2) or  [Collaboratory for the Multi-scale Chemical Sciences (CMCS)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228602526_Metadata_in_the_collaboratory_for_multi-scale_chemical_science).  The NFDI4Chem will address this issue and works on Minimum Information for Chemical Investigations (MIChI), which includes standards for methods like mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and other spectroscopic methods.

Software projects, like [electronic lab notebooks](10_eln.mdx) or [repositories](20_repositories.mdx) often define their own layer of specific minimum metadata for chemical experiments which are based on existing standards, e.g. for metabolomics, or defined by the [data formats](40_format_standards.mdx) they import. 

Existing [ontologies](50_ontology.mdx) are a good starting point to identify the information, which is necessary to describe a method, results, samples or other entities. Furthermore, controlled vocabularies and ontologies define what additional metadata is allowed to create rich metadata improve the FAIRness. Examples for formats with with corresponding ontologies or a controlled vocabularies are [mzML](https://www.psidev.info/mzML), [CIF](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif), [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/)
or the
[Allotrope Data Format (ADF)](https://docs.allotrope.org/Allotrope%20Data%20Format.html).

[The Chemical Analysis Metadata Platform (ChAMP)](https://champ.stuchalk.domains.unf.edu/) is a project, which focuses defining a framework for chemical analysis methods.
